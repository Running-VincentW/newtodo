# Todo list vue app

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/7edbd4ba-46aa-4482-86ae-035e959ac234/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/easytodo/deploys)

A simple todo list built with Vue and Bulma. The app connects to a [mock backend](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/), therefore any data you enter will not persist. You can access the live site [here](https://easytodo.netlify.app/). I would also like to thank you Traversy Media for the vuex tutorial on [youtube](https://youtu.be/Wy9q22isx3U), which have inspired this project.
